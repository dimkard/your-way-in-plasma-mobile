In terms of "KDE's Goals for 2018 and Beyond", Streamlined Onboarding of New Contributors goal has been set up. Regarding Plasma Mobile, we decided to help the growing of Plasma Mobile facilitating onboarding of new contributors. 

To serve this purpose, a new web site has been created. As soon as the potential contributors navigate to the home page of this site, a set of questions will guide them to a phabricator task.

The web site shares code with https://github.com/jdm/asknot, which has heavily influenced this project.
